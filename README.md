## Research Questions
Q1: How does the frequency of accidents vary by time of day and by different boroughs of New York; can "danger hours" and "danger zones" be identified?

Q2: Is there a clear relationship between different crash causes and the types of vehicles involved that increase injury or death rates?

Q3: Can the number of injuries in an accident be predicted using variables such as accident time, location, vehicle type, and cause of accident?
